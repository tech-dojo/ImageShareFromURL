# React Native - Share image fetched from link to apps

In this example on React Native we have demonstrated how to extract an image from a URL and share it to other local apps of your device.  <br/>
<br/>To extract the image from a URL to be shared to other local apps, we need to convert the image URL into blob (Binary Large Object).
Blob is a data type which can store large multimedia files by converting them into binary data; which makes it easier to store them.
<br/><br/>The npm packages used are - <br/>
1. [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob)
2. [react-native-share](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share)

## Running the example
<br/>1. Clone the repository  <br/><br/>
`> git clone https://github.com/tech-dojo/ImageShareFromURL.git`<br/> 
<br/>2. cd into the project file and Install all the packages  <br/><br/>
`> npm install`
<br/><br/>
3. Run the project<br/>
<br/>**android**
<br/><br/>
`> react-native run-android`
<br/><br/>
**iOS**<br/><br/>
`> react-native run-ios`
